# MakeEnvironmentCountGame
<b>During Alfa-college Make Environment Count Day 2023, I've worked on a serious game showcasing the importance of taking action against Climate Change yourself by picking up plastic before the water rises.</b><br><br>During this 4-hour development period, I've worked on this fully functional game, creating all features myself. In addition, during this same 6-hour period, I've helped various students with C#, GitHub and setting up Unity.

# Disclaimer
We had 6 hours to complete this product. Although functional, it means that code is not in a perfect state when it comes to its general quality, performance,
readability and general optimisations.

You are more than free to explore this small project yourself!

# How to use?
After cloning this repository, you can open it inside of the Unity Game Engine. It's made with Unity 2021.3.9(f1) in mind, it might not work with older or newer versions.
