# MakeEnvironmentCountGame
<b>During Alfa-college Make Environment Count Day 2023, I've worked on a serious game showcasing the importance of taking action against Climate Change yourself by picking up plastic before the water rises.</b><br><br>During this 6-hour development period, I've worked on this fully functional game, creating all features myself. In addition, during this same 6-hour period, I've helped various students with C#, GitHub and setting up Unity.

# Disclaimer
We had 6 hours to complete this product. Although functional, it means that code is not in a perfect state when it comes to its general quality, performance,
readability and general optimisations.

You are more than free to explore this small project yourself!

# How to use?
